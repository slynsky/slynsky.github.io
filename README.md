Lab 1:<br>
This lab included basic setup of students' personal computers to prepare them for the class. It also included a basic introduction to using the command terminal.

Lab 2:<br>
The purpose of lab 2 was to cursorily familiarize students with using git in the command terminal.

Lab 3:<br>
Code modules and object methods - especially object deconstruction - were the focus of this lab.

Lab 4:<br> 
This lab gave students a chance to work with fastify and creating server files. This involved use of Node, git, and MIME types, among other things.

Lab 5:<br> 
Furthering familiarity with server-side javascript, in this lab, students were asked to use postman to learn about GET and POST routes with JSON.

Lab 6:<br> 
Since javascript classes and class methods had yet to be covered in detail, that was the focus of lab 6.

Lab 7:<br> 
This week was where students began working with GitHub, so lab 7 was about learning the basics.

Lab 8:<br> 
In lab 8, students were asked to use skills they learned throughout the term. The new piece was that this lab included fetch and promises.

Lab 9:<br> 
The task of lab 9 was to work through the "Create a release based workflow" lesson on GitHub.
<br>
<br>
Project 1:<br> 
As the first project of the class, project 1 simply required students to work with visual studio code and the command terminal on a basic level.

Project 2:<br> 
The purpose of this second project was mainly to get students thinking about editing their code, so the main task was refactoring given code.

Project 3:<br> 
This project was where students were asked to create their first server and practice using a code module.

Project 4:<br> 
More server-side practice was the main objective of project 4, which asked students to use fastify, postman, and code modules to create and test dynamic outputs.

Project 5:<br> 
Students had the option to complete this project for extra credit. The task was to use classes, code modules, and refactoring to finish coding a game.

Project 6:<br> 
This project was a further exploration of classes, which also asked students to work on their debugging capabilities.

Project 7:<br> 
As opposed to a coding task, project 7 required students to create a portfolio of their work using GitHub pages.
